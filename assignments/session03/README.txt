 yt.py - Youtube Mashup
*****************************************************************

Brief Description :
    I am a big fan of youtube, therefore I decided to do this assignment on YouTube API. My program will do a search for
    the most popular video on youtube by regions. Each video is tag with duration, uploader, published date and number of view.

Think you should know:
    1) YouTube API.
        The YouTube Data API allows me to grab the data from youtube without authenticating.
    2) Knowing what regions is supported by Youtube Data API:
        I spend a lot of time searching for supported region by youtube.
        I listed over 20 different regions.
    3) In order to run yt.py, couple modules need to be installed:
        - requests
        - BeautifulSoup
        - Codecs

Source Code:
    When everything is ready. You can simply run python yt.py. If would take a couple of seconds to complete because I have over 20 different regions
    listed.

Output Example:
    Once the program is completed, a new file name most_popular.html should be created and placed in the session03 folder. Open most_popular.html
    with your favorite browser, you should see a list of popular video separated by regions.
